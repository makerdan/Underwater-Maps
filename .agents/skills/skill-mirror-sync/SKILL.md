# Skill Mirror Sync

Use this skill when adding, auditing, invoking, validating, repairing, or
investigating a workspace-managed skill projection or runtime mirror. Keep the
boundary one-way and fail closed: the workspace source is authoritative, the
project projection is generated, and the runtime mirror is disposable.

## Authority and boundaries

- `WORKSPACE_SKILLS_SOURCE` is the required, explicit, authoritative
  workspace/platform source. Treat its workspace-wide `.workspace-revision` as opaque;
  it must be present and non-empty. Never invent, infer, or silently substitute
  a fallback source.
- The generated project projection belongs only under
  `.agents/skills/.workspace-projections/`. Project-authored skills elsewhere
  under `.agents/skills/` must not be overwritten or removed.
- `.local/custom_skills/<skill-id>/` is a platform-owned runtime mirror. It is
  downstream and disposable. Never edit it directly, promote it back, or use
  its body, timestamps, or metadata to claim that the workspace source is current.
- The direction is workspace source → generated project projection → runtime mirror.
  A runtime mirror never flows back into either upstream stage, and repository
  automation must not simulate platform provisioning by writing its sidecar.
- Do not copy private workspace instructions, credentials, secrets, or a
  reconstructed registry into tracked repository files.

## Source and fingerprint contract

Before loading a skill, validate the source and projection:

1. Resolve only `WORKSPACE_SKILLS_SOURCE`; if it is unset, unreadable, not a
   directory, or has an empty `.workspace-revision`, stop with an unavailable or
   blocked result. Do not load an older projection.
2. Discover deterministic immediate source directories. Each skill directory
   must have a valid lowercase slug and `SKILL.md`. Recursively enumerate every
   regular supporting file, sort paths deterministically, and reject symlinks,
   special files, and unexpected source entries.
3. The projection manifest records its format, source revision, sorted file
   lists, and each skill fingerprint. The authoritative fingerprint is
   SHA-256 over each relative path and its bytes in sorted order, with stable
   separators. Compare the opaque revision and fingerprint exactly; do not
   derive either from timestamps. MD5 is not an authoritative fingerprint.
4. Reject a missing or malformed manifest, missing or extra files, a revision
   mismatch, a fingerprint mismatch, or any source change detected during the
   copy. These are incomplete or stale projections, never a reason to load
   old instructions.

## Safe refresh and loading

Refresh only through the supported projection helper:

1. Acquire its serialized, ownership-aware lock before inspecting or changing
   the projection. If a lock is live or cannot be safely inspected, report
   busy and do not remove active work.
2. Recover an abandoned lock only when its structured owner is provably dead,
   or an unstructured lock is provably stale under the helper's timeout.
   Recovery must be atomic and race-safe.
3. Under the lock, remove only helper-owned staging and backup directories
   whose names have the expected format and valid identifier. Never delete a
   similarly named or active directory.
4. Build the complete projection in a new staging directory. Validate its
   recursive manifest and all bytes before installation, then re-read the
   source revision. If the source changed, discard staging and retry or report
   the change; do not install a mixed snapshot.
5. Install with guarded directory renames: move an existing projection to an
   owned backup, rename staging into place, and restore the backup if the
   install fails. Clean staging and backup artifacts in a `finally` path.
   Never replace the destination by an unguarded delete-and-copy operation.
6. Validate the installed projection again immediately before loading. If the
   requested skill is absent or validation fails, fail closed. Return only
   supported content from the validated projection.

An interrupted refresh is handled by the same ownership-safe cleanup on the
next supported refresh. Do not manually rescue partial files, merge staging
contents, or load a prior projection while the source is unavailable.

## Read-only mirror status

Use the supported non-mutating command:

```sh
pnpm workspace-skill:status -- --skill <skill-id>
```

It reads the workspace source and the platform-owned
`.local/custom_skills/<skill-id>/.workspace-skill-metadata.json` sidecar. The
sidecar's format, skill ID, source revision, and fingerprint must exactly match
the canonical workspace metadata. Interpret outcomes as:

- `pass` (exit 0): identity, revision, and fingerprint match;
- `mismatch` (exit 1): mirror metadata is invalid or differs;
- `unavailable-source` (exit 2): canonical source or revision cannot be read;
- `missing-mirror` (exit 3): the platform mirror sidecar is absent.

Status is read-only. Do not write the mirror, sidecar, projection, or source
just to make a check pass. Do not print skill contents, source paths, secrets,
credentials, mirror values, or private workspace instructions. Missing
authoritative metadata is unknown/unavailable, not a pass. If the platform
does not expose authoritative mirror metadata, parity is unknown.

## Failure ownership and reporting

Classify before remediating:

| Observation | Owner | Repository action |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace content, revision, or publication is wrong | Workspace/platform skill owner | Report identity and bounded result; do not patch a mirror |
| Mirror is missing or stale after supported refresh | Workspace/platform provisioning or sync owner | Report environment, identity, and opaque metadata; request platform remediation |
| Canonical workspace source or validation metadata is unavailable | Workspace/platform owner | Report unavailable and preserve fail-closed loading |
| Projection implementation, boundary, or focused contract is wrong | Repository maintainer | Fix the repository contract or implementation |

Reports should contain the skill ID, environment, validation surface, bounded
outcome, and opaque revision or SHA-256 fingerprint when available. Include a
timestamp only if the reporting system requires it. Never fabricate a source
path, revision, fingerprint, manifest, sidecar, or success result. Hand-editing
`.local/custom_skills` is never remediation.

## Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not edit `.local/custom_skills`, reverse-promote its files, or make a
  runtime mirror authoritative.
- Do not endorse a direct canonical-to-runtime copy as a substitute for the
  workspace-source and generated-projection stages.
- Do not use MD5, timestamps, file-body comparison alone, or a made-up
  fallback source as authoritative validation.
- Do not expose or persist private workspace-level skill contents.
- Do not bypass the lock, atomic rename/rollback, source-change check, recursive
  validation, or fail-closed behavior to make invocation succeed.
